% Function made to ouptut the cleaned PHASES and the new mag based 
% on removal of bad magnitude. Bad magnitudes are removed if they are outside 
% n*sigma where n is an input.
% Amplitudes and magnitudes are not removed for bad phases they are just set
% with a 0 flag (see PHASES.WRITE_FLAG) so that we know that this magnitude will 
% not be used in the written output (event2nor), write-flag only concerns
% amplitudes writing, not picks
% 
% Input:
%    PHASES: input PHASES that has to be cleaned
%    n: into n*sigma (usually in that cases for magnitude we will take 1 or 2)
% 
% Output:
%     OUT_PHASES: cleaned phases
%     new_mag: new magnitude computed after removal
